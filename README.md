### Greetings ðŸ‘‹

My name is JosÃ© and I currently live in Chile, studying Computer Engineering at DuocUC.<br/>
I've been learning programming since I was 11 years old, I've always liked the idea of being able to tell a machine exactly what to do.<br/>
I like writing C++ code, and sometimes Python. I also know Lua and how to use it with C/C++.<br/>

### Little projects of mine
- [TheBotx](//github.com/TheClonerx/thebotx) - *the* original version of TheBotx, a bot for chatango
- [New TheBotx](//github.com/TheClonerx/new-thebotx) (in development) - new version of TheBotx, using modern features of python
- [cppnet](//github.com/TheClonerx/cppnet) - a little, easy to use networking libraries for C++
- [py-gmav](//github.com/TheClonerx/py-gmav) - Python Garry's Mod  Addon Viewer, using tkinter

### Other contributions
- [chatango-lib](//github.com/neokuze/chatango-lib) and [megach](//github.com/LinkkG/megach) - python libraries for building chatango bots
- [ipm](//github.com/ionlang/ipm) (in development) - Ion Package Manager
