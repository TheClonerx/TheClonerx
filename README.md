### Greetings ðŸ‘‹

My name is JosÃ© and I currently live in Chile, studying Computer Engineering at DuocUC.<br/>
I've been learning programming since I was 11 years old, I've always liked the idea of being able to tell a machine exactly what to do.<br/>
I like writing C++ code, and sometimes Python. I also know Lua and how to embed it in C/C++.<br/>

### Little projects of mine
- [TheBotx](//github.com/TheClonerx/thebotx) - *The* original version of TheBotx, a bot for Chatango
- [New TheBotx](//github.com/TheClonerx/new-thebotx) (in development) - New version of TheBotx, written in C++20, user programmable through Lua.
- [cppnet](//github.com/TheClonerx/cppnet) - A little, easy to use networking library for C++
- [py-gmav](//github.com/TheClonerx/py-gmav) - Python Garry's Mod  Addon Viewer, using Tkinter

### Other contributions
- [chatango-lib](//github.com/neokuze/chatango-lib) and [megach](//github.com/LinkkG/megach) - Python libraries for building Chatango bots
- [ipm](//github.com/ionlang/ipm) (in development) - Ion Package Manager
