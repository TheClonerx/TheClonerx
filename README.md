### Greetings ðŸ‘‹

My name is JosÃ© and I currently live in Chile, studying Computer Engineering at DuocUC.<br/>
I've been learning programming since I was 11 years old, I've always liked the idea of being able to tell a machine exactly what to do.<br/>
I like writing C++ code, and sometimes Python. I also know Lua and how to embed it in C/C++.<br/>

### Little projects of mine
- [TheBotx](//github.com/TheClonerx/thebotx) - *The* original version of TheBotx, a bot for Chatango, using a custom version of [ch.py](https://github.com/nhammond129/ch.py)
- [cppnet](//github.com/TheClonerx/cppnet) - A little, easy to use networking library for C++
- [bad_io](//github.com/TheClonerx/bad_io) - An async, event driven, IO library. Somewhat compatible with [asio](https://think-async.com/Asio/). 
- [py-gmav](//github.com/TheClonerx/py-gmav) - Python Garry's Mod Addon Viewer, using Tkinter
<!-- - [New TheBotx](//github.com/TheClonerx/thebotx_cxx) (in development) - New version of TheBotx, written in C++20, user programmable through Lua. -->
<!-- - [tinyws](//github.com/TheClonerx/tinyws) (in development) - A WebSocket frame parser for C, inspired on [http_parser](https://github.com/nodejs/http-parser) -->
### Other contributions
